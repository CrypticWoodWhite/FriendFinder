# Friend Finder

This is a Node.js app that matches the user to another user based on the users' responses to the questions presented. The users and their data are stored in the server, so that the number of potential matches increases as more users use this app. Matches are found based on the smallest differences in scores. If there is more than one match, the first is presented.
